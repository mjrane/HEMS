**Home Energy Management System (HEMS)**
This project introduces a comprehensive and adaptable optimization framework for Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS). In today's world, electricity plays a vital role in powering our daily lives. Recent events, such as the pandemic, have further highlighted the importance of efficient energy use in homes.

The project aims to develop a predictive model to track and identify potential energy wastage. By estimating power consumption at the device level, HEMS helps users understand their energy usage patterns. A web application provides access to predicted data and user authentication through unique login credentials.

**Methodology**
We leverage Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to process sequential data effectively. The framework utilizes real-time and historical data for training and testing, respectively. Preprocessing stages split and prepare data for efficient model training. Predicted values are presented in graphs and tables within the web application for insightful analysis. Focus on smaller granularities allows for more accurate predictions by handling a wider range of data points.
